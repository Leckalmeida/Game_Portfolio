This repository contains a collection of games I've developed as part of my portfolio.

## Games

### 1. XOXO Game (Tic Tac Toe)
Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Xs and Os, is a classic paper-and-pencil game for two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking Xs and Os in empty squares. The objective is to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

#### How to Play:

- The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
- Player 1 places an 'X' in any empty square.
- Player 2 then places an 'O' in any remaining empty square.
- Players take turns until one player gets three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or until the grid is full (resulting in a draw).

The game is simple yet strategic, often used as a learning tool for beginner game developers due to its straightforward rules and mechanics.
